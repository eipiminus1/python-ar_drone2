Python AR.Drone 2.0
================

This python script was written to control an AR Drone 2.0 with a joystick. 
It support video (with ffplay) but much work remains...

I use this joystick to control the drone : http://www.thrustmaster.com/fr_FR/produits/t16000m<br>
I take a little video about my project : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fM5P8-8vQnw<br>
(Sorry for the bad quality :/)

Demo:

There is also a demo application included which shows the video from the drone
and lets you remote-control the drone with the joystick:
